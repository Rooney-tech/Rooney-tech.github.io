# SQLPage multiple choice question example

This is a very simple example of a website that stores a list of 
possible answers to a multiple choice question in a database table,
and then displays the question and the possible answers to the user.

When the user selects an answer, the website will save the user's
choice in the database and display other users' choices as well.
