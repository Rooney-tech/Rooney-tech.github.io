## Context

This tool is written in the SQL database query language, and uses the [SQLPage](https://sql-page.com) framework to generate the web interface.

It serves as a demo for the framework.

If what you really want is to measure a tempo, not learn about website building and databases,
you should probably use something else, that does not require a web server and a database to run ðŸ˜‰.

## History

There is a large family of implementations of the tap tempo tool.

It originates from a french linux discussion website, [linuxfr.org](https://linuxfr.org/), where it was implemented in C++ by [mzf](https://linuxfr.org/users/mzf).

[See alternative implementations](https://linuxfr.org/wiki/taptempo).
