# Download the SQLPage executable for Windows 

SQLPage offers a small executable file (`sqlpage.exe`) that will take requests to your website,
execute the SQL files you write, and render the database responses as nice web pages.

[Download the latest SQLPage for Windows](https://github.com/sqlpage/SQLPage/releases/latest/download/sqlpage-windows.zip).
Download the file, and extract the executable file from the zip archive.
