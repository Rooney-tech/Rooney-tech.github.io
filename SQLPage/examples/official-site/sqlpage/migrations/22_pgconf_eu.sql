# SQLPage live on stage

Hello everyone !

If some of you european SQLPagers are around Prague this december,
I will be giving a talk about SQLPage at [pgconf.eu](https://2023.pgconf.eu/) on December 14th.

I will be talking about website building in general, SQLPage in particular,
cool things you can do with it,
how it works, how and why I built it,
and why I still think it can cut web development and prototyping times by a factor of 10.

I will also be building a tiny social network live on stage, using SQLPage.

Come see me !
