# PostgreSQL & SQLPage at PGConf 2024

We have been invited to give a talk at PGConf 2024 in Athens, Greece.

Last year, we gave a general introduction to SQLPage at PGConf.eu 2023 in Prague.

This year, we will focus on a more specific use case:
using SQLPage to build a power-tool for archaeologists to explore and understand archaeological sites,
radically changing the way archaeologists work, and allowing them to
drastically reduce the time spent on data entry and management.

There will be two presenters:
 - **Ophir Lojkine**, the creator and maintainer of SQLPage, will present the project and its capabilities.
 - **Thomas Guillemard**, an archaeologist from France''s National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research, will present the project''s use case and its benefits.

Come and see us in Athens !
