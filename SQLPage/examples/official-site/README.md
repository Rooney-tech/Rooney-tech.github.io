# Official SQLPage site

The SQLPage website is of course built with SQLPage !

Things that you may be interested to look at:
 - The [custom component we use for our stylish home page](./sqlpage/templates/shell-home.handlebars)
 - The [migrations](./sqlpage/migrations) that populate the database with the documentation for all components
 - The [advanced multistep form example](./examples/multistep-form/)

It is hosted as a simple Docker container on [sql-page.com](https://sql-page.com).

Feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/lovasoa/sqlpage/pulls) if you would like to add or change anything !
