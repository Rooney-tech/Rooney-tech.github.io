SQLPage is a tool that allows you to **build websites** using nothing more than **SQL queries**.
You write simple text files containing SQL queries, SQLPage runs them on your database, and **renders the results as a website**.

You can display the information you `SELECT` from your database in
lists, tables, charts, maps, forms, and many other user interface widgets.
But you can also `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` data from your database using SQLPage, and build a full webapp.' as description_md,

    These components are built using traditional web technologies, but you never have to edit them if you don''t want to.
    SQLPage populates the components with data returned by your SQL queries.
    You can build entire web applications just by combining the components that come bundled with SQLPage.

As an example, the list of features on this page is generated using a simple SQL query that looks like this:

```sql
SELECT ''card'' as component, ''What is SQLPage ?'' as title;
SELECT header AS title, contents AS description_md FROM homepage_features;
```

However, you can also create your own components, or edit the existing ones to customize your website to your liking.
Creating a new component is as simple as creating an HTML template file.

    'SQLPage removes a lot of the complexity and bloat of the modern web.
It''s a **lightweight web server** that just receives a request, finds the file to execute, runs it,
and returns a web page for the browser to display.

Written in a fast and secure programming language ([**Rust**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))),
it empowers non-developers to build secure web applications easily. You download [a single executable file](https://github.com/sqlpage/SQLPage/releases),
write an `index.sql`, and in five minutes you turned your database into a website that you can
[deploy on the internet easily](https://datapage.app).

We made all the [optimizations](performance.sql), wrote all of the HTTP request handling code and rendering logic,
implemented all of the security features, so that you can think about your data, and nothing else.

When SQLPage receives a request, it finds the corresponding SQL file (with or without the .sql extension), runs it on the database, passing it information from the web request as SQL statement parameters [in a safe manner](safety.sql).
When the database starts returning rows for the query,
SQLPage maps each piece of information in the row to a parameter in the template of a pre-defined component,
and streams the result back to the user's browser.

and wrap them in a more established framework with a dedicated front end if you need to.
There is no lock-in, only simple, standard SQL queries that run directly on your database.
